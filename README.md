# Hardware_KNN
This repository contains the files for a hardware accelerated KNN implemented in ZedBoard to achieve near real time inference for Edge applications.

## OBJECTIVE
  To design and implement a hardware ip for KNN using Xilinx Vivado and Zedboard to achieve near real time inference. 

## OVERVIEW
  KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours) is a classification algorithm that uses lazy learning to predict the class of an input sample by computing the distances to every point in the dataset and the input sample and choose the class based on 'K' Nearest Neighbours through majority voting. The K value decides the number of nearest neighbours to check for.
